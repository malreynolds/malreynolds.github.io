Welcome to the first post in a series of Educational Codeforces Round posts. I think these rounds are a great opportunity for people to get into competitive programming, but the lack of good editorials can make them a bit difficult to understand for complete beginners. Hopefully this series will fill some of the gaps the reader (or myself) might have. 

The goal is to do one of these every week and to include as much detail and explanation as possible.


On that note, onto the contest! I encourage you to practice the round yourself [here](http://codeforces.com/contest/598/), before looking at the solutions. 

# [Problem A - Tricky Sum](http://codeforces.com/contest/598/problem/A)
In this problem you are to calculate the sum of all integers from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\), but you should take all powers of two with minus in the sum.

For example, for \\( n = 4 \\) the sum is equal to  \\(-1-2+3-4=-4\\), because \\(1\\), \\(2\\) and \\(4\\) are \\(2^0\\), \\(2^1\\) and \\(2^2\\) respectively.

Calculate the answer for \\(t\\) values of \\(n\\).

### Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer \\(t\\) \\((1 ≤ t ≤ 100)\\) — the number of values of \\(n\\) to be processed.

Each of next t lines contains a single integer \\(n\\) \\((1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9)\\).

### Output
Print the requested sum for each of \\(t\\) integers \\(n\\) given in the input.
