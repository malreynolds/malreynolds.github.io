Welcome to my first post. You will find nothing interesting here. I mean the post, not the website. Well, eventually anyway...

One the one hand, this is just a test to see if my setup works. This whole thing would be quite silly if it didn't. More importantly though, this post is also a promise. A promise that I will keep updating this blog so much that eventually this embarrassing post will disappear under a pile of all the interesting content I am going to write, so that no one will ever see it again.

So here is what is on the agenda. First, I plan on doing coding competitions again. I will do all the available educational rounds on [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/) before doing so, so I expect to have a post for each round, after which I will continue with the normal rounds.

Second on my list is tidying up and adding my projects. I have completed the first terms of the Udacity's [Self-Driving Car Engineer](https://udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) and [Artificial Intelligence](https://udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) nanodegrees so I will probably start there.

Since this is supposed to test everything, here are some useless code snippets to test code highlighting. As a bonus, they include show how my friends call me. See you next time!

{% highlight python %}
def print_hello(name):
  print("Hi,", name)
print_hello('Nasko')
# Outputs "Hi, Nasko" to STDOUT
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, Nasko" << endl;
    return 0;
}
// Outputs "Hi, Nasko" to STDOUT
{% endhighlight %}
