Welcome to my first post. You won't find anything interesting here. I mean the post, not the website. Well, eventually anyway...

This is just a test to see if my setup works. This whole thing would be quite silly if it didn't. 

So here is what is on the agenda. First, I've been thinking about getting into competitive programming again. I intend to do all the available educational rounds on [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/) before doing so, so I expect to have a post for each round, after which I will continue with the normal rounds.

Second on my list is tidying up and adding my projects. I have completed the first terms of the Udacity's [Self-Driving Car Engineer](https://udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) and [Artificial Intelligence](https://udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) nanodegrees so I will probably start there.

Since I am supposed to test stuff out, here are some useless code snippets to test code highlighting. As a bonus for getting through all this, they show how my friends call me. See you next time!

{% highlight python %}
def print_hello(name):
  print("Hi,", name)
print_hello('Nasko')
# Outputs "Hi, Nasko" to STDOUT
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, Nasko"; 
    return 0;
}
// Outputs "Hello, Nasko" to STDOUT
{% endhighlight %}
